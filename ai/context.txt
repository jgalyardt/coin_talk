I am creating an Elixir Phoenix back-end for a Vue 3 front-end called coin_talk.
The concept is two charts on the left: Bitcoin and $USD.
To the right is a chat box. There are two chat bots, Al1c3 and B0b, which use Gemini's free tier to discuss what's going on in the markets.
Users can chat too, and the bots will react based on the conversation.
There need to be rate limits on everything to keep it completely free.
Focus on the back-end API implementation.
Give me the full output of any changed files.
