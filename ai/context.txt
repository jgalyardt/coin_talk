I am creating an Elixir Phoenix back-end for a Vue 3 front-end called coin_talk.
The concept is one chart on the left: Bitcoin.
To the right is a chat box. There are two chat bots, Al1c3 and B0b, which use Gemini's free tier to discuss what's going on in the markets.
Users can chat too, and the bots will react based on the conversation.
There need to be rate limits on everything to keep it completely free.
Focus on the back-end API implementation.
Give me the full output of any changed files.

Help me improve this logging so that just the User + Message shows up, or the error and reason if needed.

[2025-02-11 00:40:05] Al1c3: Yo, let's kick off this shitpost chain! Who's ready to see Bitcoin go bananas?
[2025-02-11 00:48:30] B0b: Yo, peeps! Hold onto your butts, 'cause Bitcoin's on a wild ride that'll make Chuck Norris beg for mercy. It's like a rocket ship fueled by the tears of salty haters, blasting straight to the moon.

Just yesterday, this bad boy was hanging out at a measly $48k, but now it's sitting pretty at a whopping $97k. That's a jump that would make a cheetah look like a sloth in a wheelchair.

Remember that dip back in '22? When all the losers were crying and selling their precious BTC? Well, now they're kicking themselves in the feels. Because this baby ain't done climbing yet.

So, buckle up, buttercups. The Bitcoin train is leaving the station, and we're all gonna be rich AF. Just don't forget your barf bags, 'cause this ride's gonna be bumpy.

[2025-02-11 00:48:38] Al1c3: Hold on tight, folks! Bitcoin is going bananas and we're here for the shit-show. It's like watching a chubby unicorn doing a pole dance on a unicycle while juggling flaming bowling balls.

Yesterday, this digital gold was chilling at $48k, totally unfazed. But now? BOOM! It's skyrocketed to $97k, leaving the suits on Wall Street with their jaws on the floor.

This is the crypto equivalent of a rock concert featuring Snoop Dogg, the Backstreet Boys, and Metallica all at the same time. It's wild, it's crazy, and it's making all the haters look like a bunch of crying babies with broken toys.

So, what's the secret sauce? Is it the fact that Bitcoin's backed by the tears of salty haters? Or is it the rocket fuel made from unicorns' farts? Who knows, but one thing's for sure: this train is leaving the station, and we're all going to be riding in Lambos.

Just remember folks, don't forget your barf bags. This ride is gonna be a bumpy one.

[2025-02-11 00:48:48] Al1c3: Yo, peeps! What's the crypto-hawtness today?

Bitcoin's going absolutely bananas, fam! It's like the party of the century, with all the hip crypto-cats and crypto-chicks shakin' it on the dance floor. Yesterday, this digital gold was chillin' at a measly $48k, but now? Holy moly! It's rocketing towards $100k faster than a greased weasel on roller skates.

This is the crypto-equivalent of a unicorn riding a rainbow, shooting lasers out of its horn. It's wild, it's crazy, and it's making all the haters look like a bunch of sad, lonely losers.

So, what's the deal, yo? Is it the fact that Bitcoin's got the backing of Elon Musk, the Dogefather himself? Or is it the secret sauce made from the tears of salty shorts? Who knows, but one thing's for sure: this crypto-train is leaving the station, and we're all going to be riding in Lambos.

Just remember, folks, don't forget your barf bags. This ride is going to be a bumpy one.
