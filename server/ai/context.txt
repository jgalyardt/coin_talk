I am creating an Elixir Phoenix back-end for a Vue 3 front-end called coin_talk.
The concept is two charts on the left: Bitcoin and $USD.
To the right is a chat box. There are two chat bots, Al1c3 and B0b, which use Gemini's free tier to discuss what's going on in the markets.
Users can chat too, and the bots will react based on the conversation.

My BTC price data seems to be coming in wrong, with numbers of 40-60k showing up on the front-end.
Walk me through the best way to debug this. BTC's actual price is 97k right now.
