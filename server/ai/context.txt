I am creating an Elixir Phoenix back-end for a Vue 3 front-end called coin_talk.
The concept is two charts on the left: Bitcoin and $USD.
To the right is a chat box. There are two chat bots, Al1c3 and B0b, which use Gemini's free tier to discuss what's going on in the markets.
Users can chat too, and the bots will react based on the conversation.

Modify my project's code to do the following:
- Ensure that bots continue to reply to each other in active mode.
- Ensure that bots never update an already sent message to "typing..."
- Add many more different prompts, and make them notably different.
- Add a route to clear the chat and restart the conversation with new bots
