I am creating an Elixir Phoenix back-end for a Vue 3 front-end called coin_talk.
The concept is two charts on the left: Bitcoin and $USD.
To the right is a chat box. There are two chat bots, Al1c3 and B0b, which use Gemini's free tier to discuss what's going on in the markets.
Users can chat too, and the bots will react based on the conversation.
There need to be rate limits on everything to keep it completely free.
Focus on the back-end API implementation.
Give me the full output of any changed files.

Modify my project's code to do the following:
- Bot actions should be staggered by 1-3 seconds randomly
- Before the bot makes a request to the Gemini API, send a response to the user that indicates this bot is doing so. This will be used to render a "B0b is typing..." message on the client.
- Add a seeds function that wipes the chat database and sets a new context prompt to start the conversation
- Think of one more feature of your own and add it
